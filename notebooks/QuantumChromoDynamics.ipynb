    "The simplest case that can prove to be of scientific use will be to consider a gas of momentum plane-wave neutrinos, undergoing two-body interactions without a complicating matter background, in the relativistic limit.

Thus, the goal will be to see how equilibration is reached for flavor distribution of a single momentum mode for a given distribution of initial neutrino momenta and flavors."
