    "Core-collapse supernovae are among the most catostrophic events in the universe, and play an important role in cosmological history, providing an engine by which elements heavier than iron can be synthesized. Although supernovae are ultimately driven by the microscopic mechanisms in nuclear physics, their simulation naively appears to be a problem of classical physics of transport and fluid dynamics. However, these supernovae generate a tremendous number of neutrinos, with the bulk of the energy of the supernova being carried away by the neutrinos.\n",
