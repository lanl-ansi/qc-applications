    "An area where quantum chemistry can offer immediate solutions to the ever-growing energy demand and climate change challenges is by enhancing our understanding of artificial photosynthesis. Artificial photosynthesis aims to replicate and optimize the natural process of converting sunlight, water, and carbion dioxide into energy-rich fuels, resulting in a more sustainable and carbon-neutral energy cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artifical photosynthesis is a multi-step process that begins with the absorption of sunlight, leading to charge separation and the oxidation of water ($H_{2}0$), which produces oxygen ($O_2$), protons ($H^+$), and electrons ($e^-$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrons and protons extracted from the previous step are used for $CO_2$ reduction to faciliate the production of fuels. This involves reducing $CO_2$ into either CO, hydrocarbons like methan, or other carbonhydrates such as glucose. \n",

    "In this notebook, we dive into the process of down-selecting a pool of catalysts for water oxidation and catalysts for the $CO_{2} $ reduction reaction. For each mechanism, the ultimate goal is to estimate the ground state electronic structure per transition states to calculate the energy barrier for the reaction pathway to unconver superior catalysts. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main steps to estimating the ground state energy of the reaction:\n",
    "1. Generate the electronic hamiltonian in the second-quantization form (also known as molecular hamiltonian) per state of the reaction\n",
    "2. Prepare an initial state that provides sufficient overlap with the true ground states, boosting the success probability of the phase estimation for the reactive system. This can be achieved by the linear combination of the HF state and selected configuration\n",
    "interaction singles (CIS) states. These multireference states can be easily prepared with rotations and entanglement gates.\n",
    "3. Perform a mapping between Qubit operators and Fermionic operators. This can be achieved using either a Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, or parity encoding.\n",
    "4. Perform Ground State Energy Estimation on the mapped qubit hamiltonian to estimate the activation energy of the reaction.\n",
    "5. With the qubit Hamiltonian and initial state, we are now ready to measure the energies of the reaction of interest.\n",

    "Once the initial state has been prepared, we can now perform Quantum Phase Estimation to estimate the ground state energy of each electronic hamiltonian. Currently we are using a short evolution time and a second order trotterization with a single step. We will use scaling arguments to determine the final resources since generating the full circuit for a large number of trotter steps with many bits of precision is quite costly."
