    "Enhancing our understanding of artificial photosynthesis could offer immediate solutions to the ever-growing energy demand and climate change challenges. Artificial photosynthesis aims to replicate and optimize the natural process of converting sunlight, water, and carbion dioxide into energy-rich fuels, resulting in a more sustainable and carbon-neutral energy cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial photosynthesis is a multi-step process that begins with the absorption of sunlight, leading to charge separation and the oxidation of water ($H_{2}0$), which produces oxygen ($O_2$), protons ($H^+$), and electrons ($e^-$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrons and protons extracted from the previous step are used for $CO_2$ reduction to faciliate the production of fuels. This involves reducing $CO_2$ into either CO, hydrocarbons like methan, or other carbonhydrates such as glucose. \n",

    "In this notebook, we dive into the process of down-selecting a pool of catalysts for water oxidation. The ultimate goal is to estimate the ground state electronic structure per transition states to calculate the energy barrier for the reaction pathway to unconver superior catalysts. Given this, our computational targets for this notebook are strictly the ground states and forces. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are five main steps to estimating the ground state energy of the reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate the electronic hamiltonian in the second-quantized form (also known as molecular hamiltonian) for each state of the reaction pathway. Using a second-quantized formulation results in a simpler hamiltonian as it's easier to impose particle symmetry. Additionally, it's much easier to prepare the initial states on a quantum computer. However, recent work indicates that there may be advantages in gate complexity using a first quantization formulation [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12767). \n",
    "2. Prepare an initial state that provides sufficient overlap with the true ground states, boosting the success probability of the phase estimation for the reactive system. One way how this can be achieved is through a linear combination of the HF state and selected configuration interaction singles (CIS) states. Performing the initialization in this fashion should allign the initial state's energy to a low enough energy subspace of the quantum system. These product states can be prepared by applying local unitary rotations to end up with some possible state such as |0..011..1>\n",
    "3. Perform a mapping between Qubit operators and Fermionic operators. This will result in a Hamiltonian represented in the Pauli basis. This can be achieved through methods such as Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, or parity encoding. For this notebook, we will be using Jordan-Wigner, which is handled by openfermion, to perform this mapping.\n",
    "4. Perform Ground State Energy Estimation on the mapped qubit hamiltonian on a quantum computer to estimate the ground state energies of the transition states along the reaction pathway.\n",
    "5. Compute activation energies between the transition states. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Here, we present illustration of the workflow for the steps above for the example of water oxidation: $Co_2O_9H_{12}$ catalysis [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp511805x)."

In this case, a Hartree-Fock (HF) computation serves as a good initial approximation for each state's initial state. We do the following to grab the initial state of each state along the reaction pathway:\n",

Once we have a molecular orbital representation of the Fermionic Hamiltonian, the HF state is |00..011..1>, in molecular representation, where the numbers of 0 and 1 are equal to the number of unoccupied and occupied moleular orbitals, termed as Nvir and Nocc, respectively. For preparing this state on a quantum computer, we only need to apply bit flip gates to `nocc` qubits to prepare the HF state as the state's initial state. This will result in a depth-1 circuit of X gates.\n",

    "# Ground State Energy Estimation (GSEE)\n",
    "Once the initial state is prepared, we can now perform Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to estimate the ground state energy of each molecular hamiltonian along the reaction pathway. The initial prepared state used is the Fock state from each molecular hamiltonian.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this example, we choose an energy precision of up to 1 millihartree, requiring up to 10 bits of precision. On top of this, we will be be performing a second order suzuki-trotter evaluation to estimate the ground state energy. To simplify this problem, we are using a short evolution time and a second order trotterization with a single step. Scaling arguments are used to determine the final resources since generating the full circuit for a large number of trotter steps with many bits of precision is quite costly and will increase the compilation time. The circuit depth scales linearly with the number of trotter steps and exponentially base 2 for the number of bits of precision. This comes at the cost of a higher error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative approaches for specifying these parameters involve using openfermion to uncover the number of trotter steps is necessary for accurately estimating the ground state which can result in better GSEE circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that recently, there has been a pyLIQTR release that performs QPE with Quantum Signal processing (QSP) as a sub-process. This can yield potential improvements in resource estimates, however, this has yet to be explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we grab a quarter of the molecular hamiltonian's Hartree-Fock energy to represent the minimum energy to calculate the phase offset needed for estimating the ground state energy of some stage within the reaction pathway. This is handled by the `grab_molecular_phase_offset` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though not shown explicitly here, when we pass the molecular hamiltonian as arguments to generating a circuit for estimating the ground state energy, pyLIQTR performs a Jordan-Wigner transformation on it. This operation maps the fermionic operators to qubit operators, now allowing us to apply quantum algorithms on the hamiltonian. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a circuit is generated to estimate the ground state energy for each molecular hamiltonian, we translate the circuit to a fault tolerant gate set, i.e, Clifford + T gateset, to grab its resource estimates. The resource estimates are encoded as JSON files which contains all of the resource estimates for a given molecular hamiltonian."

After performing QPE, we can calculate the activation energy of the reaction. The activation energy is essential in assessing the feasibility and kinetics of a reaction and directly influencing the efficiency of a catalyst. By accurately computing the activation energies for each step of the reaction pathway, we can predict the rate at which the reaction will proceed under different conditions.\n",
