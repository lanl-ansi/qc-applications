    "Enhancing our understanding of artificial photosynthesis could offer immediate solutions to the ever-growing energy demand and climate change challenges.

    "In this notebook, we illustrate the process of catalyst down-selection for the water oxidation reaction. The ultimate goal is to estimate the ground state electronic structure per transition state to calculate the activation energy barriers for the reaction pathway. The activation energy represents an important quantity that is crucial for determining rate constant of the reaction using the Arrhenius law.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five main steps to estimating the ground state energy of the reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate the electronic hamiltonian in the second-quantized form (also known as molecular hamiltonian) for each state of the reaction pathway. Using a second-quantized formulation results in a simpler hamiltonian as it's easier to impose particle symmetry. Additionally, it's much easier to prepare the initial states on a quantum computer. However, recent work indicates that there may be advantages in gate complexity using a first quantization formulation [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12767). \n",
    "2. Prepare an initial state that provides sufficient overlap with the true ground states, boosting the success probability of the phase estimation for the reactive system. One way how this can be achieved is through a linear combination of the HF state and selected configuration interaction singles (CIS) states. Performing the initialization in this fashion should allign the initial state's energy to a low enough energy subspace of the quantum system. These product states can be prepared by applying local unitary rotations to end up with some possible state such as |0..011..1>\n",
    "3. Perform a mapping between Qubit operators and Fermionic operators. This will result in a Hamiltonian represented in the Pauli basis. This can be achieved through methods such as Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, or parity encoding. For this notebook, we will be using Jordan-Wigner, which is handled by openfermion, to perform this mapping.\n",
    "4. Perform Ground State Energy Estimation on the mapped qubit hamiltonian on a quantum computer to estimate the ground state energies of the transition states along the reaction pathway.\n",
    "5. Compute activation energies between the transition states. \n",

    "Here, we present illustration of the workflow for the steps above for the example of water oxidation: $Co_2O_9H_{12}$ catalysis [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp511805x)."

To simplify this problem, we are using a short evolution time and a second order trotterization with a single step. Scaling arguments are used to determine the final resources since generating the full circuit for a large number of trotter steps with many bits of precision is quite costly and will increase the compilation time.

This operation maps the fermionic operators to qubit operators, now allowing us to apply quantum algorithms on the hamiltonian. \n",
