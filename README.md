# Quantum Computing Application Specifications

This projct focuses on the documentation of applications for Quantum Computers. Currently, we have four notebooks exploring four different applications, which can be found in
the notebooks/ directory. For taking a look at notebooks that are going through ongoing development, one can take a look at the `notebook/exotic-phases-nb` and `notebook/dicke-model-nb`
branches.
