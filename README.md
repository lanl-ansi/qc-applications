# Quantum Computing Application Specifications

This project focuses on the documentation of applications for Quantum Computers. Quantum Computing Application (QCA) is a python library for constructing quantum circuits for a set of
kernels and applications from the corresponding paper, and generating a series of resource estimates from it. All resource estimates are in the Clifford + T gateset. 

QCA is structured the following:
- notebooks/
    - A series of jupyter notebooks corresponding to each chapter in the paper which describes on how the application's workflow would look like. The following is a mapping of the notebook to its corresponding chapter on the report
        - ExoticPhasesExample.ipynb -> Chapter 3. Exploring exotic phases of magnetic materials near instabilities
        - DickeModelExample.ipynb -> Chapter 4. Driven-dissipative Dicke model in the ultrastrong coupling regime
        - HighTemperatureSuperConductorExample.ipynb -> Chapter 5. High-temperature superconductivity and exotic properties of FermiHubbard models
        - ArtificialPhotosynthesisExample.ipynb -> Chapter 6. Computational catalysis for artificial photosynthesis
        - QuantumChromoDynamicsExample.ipynb -> Chapter 7. Simulations of quantum chromodynamics and nuclear astrophysics
- scripts/
    - Python scripts that allows an end user to run an application over the command line
- qca.utils
    - Module that contains utility functions regarding constructing circuits for a given application'
- tests/
    - Unit test cases to verify QCA's functionality

After running some program, you'd get the following output:
```json
{
    [(OPTIONAL) block of metadata information]
    [block of resource estimates]
}
```
where the block of metadata information is the following (note that any key below is optional):
```json
{
    "name": str, // Name of the experiment
    "category": str, // Type of experiment such as scientific or industrial
    "size": str, // Size of the Hamiltonian
    "task": str, // The computational task such as ground_state_energy_estimation and time_dependent_dynamics
    "implementation": str, // Description of the implementation such as block encoding used
    "value": float, // The utility estimate in US dollars for the problem
    "value_per_t_gate": float, // The utility estimate value per t gate,
    "repetitions_per_application": int, // Total number of times to repeat the circuit to realize its utility
    "is_extrapolated": bool, // Denoting if the circuit was extrapolated to save compute time
    "gate_synth_accuracy": float, // The approximation error to decompose the circuit
    "nsteps": int, // Total number of steps taken
    "evolution_time": float, // Total evolution time
    "energy_precision": float, // Acceptable shift in state energy
}
```

where the block of resource estimations is the following:
```json
{
    "num_qubits": int, // number of qubits in the system
    "t_count": int, // total number of T gates
    "clifford_count": int, // total number of clifford gates
    "gate_count": int, // total number of gates
    "gate_depth": int, // total gate depth
    "subcircuit_occurences": int, // total number of times we come across this subcircuit
    "t_depth": int, // total T depth
    "max_t_depth_wire": int, // maximum number of T-gates on a wire
}
```

unless stated otherwise, the output will be generated as "{application_name}_re.json"
